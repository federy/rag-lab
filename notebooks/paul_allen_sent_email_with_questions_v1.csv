"liane, as we discussed yesterday, i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the el paso san juan monthly index. a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index. at the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan. we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27. these are the complete list of trades from enron online (eol), enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (amerex, apb, and prebon). please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships. the two key points from this data are as follows: 1. the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & northwest) is consistent between the end of september and october gas daily. it doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers. i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. it is enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business. please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal. sincerely, phillip allen",<23408645.1075855667925.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Thu, 28 Sep 2000 05:56:00 -0700 (PDT",Jeffrey T Hodg,False,"['What dates were the questionable trades executed that Phillip Allen is concerned about?', 'What were the prices per unit of san juan gas during the suspicious trades?', 'How much lower were the other physical gas offers compared to the prices paid by the single buyer?', 'What key comparison does Phillip Allen make between high physical prices and high financial trades on those days?', 'Which three brokerage firms are mentioned in the email?', 'What does Phillip Allen believe about the trades at $4.70 and higher?', 'What does Phillip Allen hope to achieve regarding the index calculations?']"

"steve, i am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. if you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. as far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. examine ldc's incentive rate program. current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. the result is that the ldc's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. this creates a shortage in later months. 2. california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. specific questions should include: 1. why in march '00-may '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. why are there so many examples of ofo's on weekends that push away too much gas from socal's system. i believe socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. they repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. not enough forward hedging is done by the major ldcs. by design the customers are short at a floating rate. this market has been long historically. it has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. call me if you need any more input. phillip",<19155794.1075855699560.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Fri, 22 Dec 2000 07:06:00 -0800 (PST",Steven J Kea,False,"['What is the home number provided for contact?', ""What does the current methodology of LDC's incentive rate program reward?"", ""What issue arises from the LDC's selling gas that should be injected into storage?"", 'What specific operational question is raised regarding March to May 2000?', ""What does the email suggest about SoCalGas's forecasting of demand?"", 'What benchmarking issue is mentioned regarding major LDCs?', ""How has the market historically been described in terms of buyer's and consumer benefits?""]"

"george, here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. at permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, i feel the 65/35 is a fair split. however, as i mentioned earlier, i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in november) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 phillip",<2422582.1075855699234.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Tue, 9 Jan 2001 09:51:00 -0800 (PST",<cbpres@austin.rr.com,False,"['What is the fixed construction profit amount proposed in the email?', 'What are the conditions under which additional equity can be earned by the builder?', ""What is the expected payout of the investment and builder's profit in the first year?"", 'How much equity is proposed for completion on budget and ahead of schedule?', 'What equity split is suggested based on different performance outcomes?', 'What is the phone number provided for further discussion?', 'What is the price per square foot mentioned for phase 1 completion?', ""What percentage of the builder's profit is expected to be recouped in the first year?"", 'What is the proposed final equity split range based on performance?']"

"by steve everly - the kansas city star date: 01/20/01 22:15 as natural gas prices rose in december, traders at the new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said william burson, a trader. ""it makes the market for natural gas."" but the market's response perplexed chris mcgill, the american gas association's director of gas supply and transportation. he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""it's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" mcgill said. as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street. stephen adik, senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""it's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly. in california, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""we're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said paul snider, a spokesman for missouri gas energy. but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""there's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass. hot topic consumers know one thing for certain: their heating bills are up sharply. in many circles, little else is discussed. the rev. vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a $1,456 december bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous december's bill. church members are suffering from higher bills as well. the sunday collection is down, said fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. for the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""it's the talk of the town here,"" he said. a year ago that wasn't a fear. wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. but trouble was brewing. by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. there was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. by early november, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. but $10 gas was coming. below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the kansas city area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""it's all about the weather,"" said krapels of energy security analysis. wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the new york traders. natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. setting the price in the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. in 1990, the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. and big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. that leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. by the end of the month it was nearly $10. much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association's weekly storage numbers. utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. still, the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. then the american gas association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. still, said the association's mcgill, there was sufficient gas in storage. but some utility executives didn't share that view. william eliason, vice president of kansas gas service, said that if december's cold snap had continued into january, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""i was getting worried,"" he said. then suddenly the market turned when january's weather turned warmer. wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. among area utilities, kansas gas service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin wednesday. sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. missouri gas energy has no hedging program. it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. on friday, doug micheel, senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel, said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy's gas purchasing practices. ""consumers are taking all the risk,"" micheel said.

"jeff, before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. there are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. what is an outside management firm going to do? a full time onsite manager is all that is required. as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. considering #1 & #2 $115,000 noi is not necessarily overstated. if you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. getting cash out is not a priority to me. so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. a 10% note actually attractive. see below. my job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. sales price 705,000 1st lien 473,500 2nd lien 225,000 transfer fee 7,500 cash required 14,500 noi 100,000 1st lien 47,292 2nd lien 23,694 cash flow 29,014 cash on cash 200% these numbers are using the conservative noi, if it comes in at $115k then cash on cash return would be more like 300%. this doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price. do you want to reconsider? let me know. phillip",<2754791.1075855698286.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Wed, 31 Jan 2001 08:20:00 -0800 (PST",Jeff Smith,False,"['What are the specific operating expenses mentioned in the email?', 'How much does a full-time onsite maintenance man save in extra labor costs?', 'What is the proposed benefit of having an onsite manager instead of an outside management firm?', 'What is the estimated conservative net operating income (NOI) that Phillip Allen mentioned?', 'What are the sales price, first lien, and second lien amounts outlined in the deal?', 'What is the cash flow and cash on cash return based on the conservative NOI mentioned in the email?', ""What is Phillip Allen's priority regarding cash out for this property, and what type of note is he willing to structure?"", ""What additional profit opportunity does Phillip mention regarding the property's future?""]"
